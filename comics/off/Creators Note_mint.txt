Title: Off
By: mint

Since the motif for this years anthology is distance I wanted to depict it in a psychological way.
"Off" = not being oneself, this short story basically shows a person slowly losing his grasp on reality.
I added subtle things in some panels that (may) add flavour to the story... so hopefully you notice that ^_^ 

Yo mint here! Thanks for taking time in reading my first ever webtoon.
I haven't drawn in a long time (lol) so thanks for bearing with it.
