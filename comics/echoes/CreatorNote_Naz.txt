Title: Echoes
By: Naz

The short visual novel details the journey of a lone cosmonaut, stranded 
in a planet of frost as their starship crash-lands into the icy tundras.
The creeping fate of their own demise slowly seeps into their psyche as the
environment itself is a testament of their will to live. In the vast expanse
of the dead planet, only the echoes of their PDA would be their companion.
