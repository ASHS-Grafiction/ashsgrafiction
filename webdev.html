            <p>If this is being read in the future and I haven't been replaced by someone with more tech-savvy who's willing to handle any technical problems, contact Jacob Meimban at <em>jacob.meimban@obf.ateneo.edu. </em>Send me an email about your issue and I'll get back to you in at most 24-48 hours.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Oswald, sans-serif;"><br><strong><em>Creating Pages</em></strong><br></h1>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Creating Pages</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>Open <em>Bootstrap Studio. </em>You'll see the <em>File</em> button at your top-left. Click it and a dropdown menu will fall. Click open and open your downloaded copy of Grafiction's source file. The source file should have the extension .bsdesign.</p><img src="/assets/img/open.png">
            <p>I'm not going to try and teach the entirety of <em>Bootstrap Studio</em>. I will however, drop this <a href="https://bootstrapstudio.io/docs/" target="_blank">link to the official documentation</a> and there's also the tutorial and examples built into Bootstrap Studio you can use (it can be seen when you open the app as the <strong>Tutorials</strong> tab next to <strong>Recent Designs</strong>).<br><br>Before moving on however, I'll emphasize the need to turn on <strong>Automatic Backups</strong> as accidents do and will happen. To do so, open the <em>File </em>menu again but hover on <em>Backups </em>and click <em>Backup Settings</em>. If&nbsp;<strong>Automatic Backups </strong>aren't on, turn them on and set the frequency to whatever you prefer.<br></p>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Source Control</em><br><br></h5>
            <p><em>Source control </em>refers to the system we use to track and keep ourselves up-to-date with all the changes made to the website. The process of making changes, exporting those changes, and uploading them depends on which process we're doing, <em>creating pages</em> or <em>uploading comics</em>.<br><br>With pages, once you have the page looking the way you want it and you've previewed it in action you're ready to upload it to our source control system: <strong>Github</strong>. Here projects are stored in what we call&nbsp;<em>repositories. </em>You're going to be making changes to our website's repository.<br><br>First, save the project <em>(by hitting Ctrl+S or&nbsp;⌘+S)</em>&nbsp;then click on the arrow next to <strong>Export </strong>(to your top-left). A drop-down menu should show then click <strong>Export Settings</strong>. Make sure to set your settings to the following:</p><img src="/assets/img/settings.png">
            <p><em>The exception to this being the </em><strong><em>Export Destination.</em></strong><br><br>Set that to where your computer has the Github repository stored. You can find out where by opening Github Desktop (and while in the ASHS Grafiction repository) clicking on the button encircled below:</p><img src="/assets/img/show.png">
            <p>Now you can click <strong>Export </strong>and Bootstrap Studio will make the appropriate changes to the repository.&nbsp;After setting your settings once, you can skip this step from here on and just click <strong>Export </strong>as Bootstrap Studio will just use your last used settings.<br><br>The repository on your computer has been updated but there's still the task of uploading this to the online copy of the website. Go back to Github Desktop, there should be a list of changes made that looks something like this:</p><img src="/assets/img/changes.png">
            <p>There should also be a form stating <em>Summary (required).</em>&nbsp;Just write a very short description (1 fragment or sentence) that describes what you changed <em>(misc. improvements, design fixes, added new comic, etc.). </em>Don't do this:</p><img src="/assets/img/be%20better%20than%20me.png">
            <p>Because a descriptive summary will give you clues as to what has changed over time in case something goes wrong. If something does go wrong, we can <strong>revert </strong>to a previous version of the website. I'll put the instructions for that in the FAQs.<br><br>However, right now we're not reverting changes we're <strong>pushing</strong>&nbsp;them. Once you've written what you need, hit <strong>Commit</strong>. Then once it's done, press <strong>Push Origin</strong>. Wait for the files to be uploaded and the public website itself will update with your changes in at most 5 minutes. Congrats! You've changed the website. Make sure to go to the website to make sure nothing catastrophic has happened (this occasionally happens where a change will look fine when previewed but transform dramatically when uploaded).<br><br>Also make sure that if someone else has made changes and pushed them that you later <strong>Pull Origin </strong>before making any new changes (this is like <strong>SUPER IMPORTANT</strong>). Those changes you made were also applied to the <em>.bsdesign</em> file so make sure to upload that new version to your shared GDrive.<br><br>Now that we know how to edit and make new pages, let's actually put some comics on those pages.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Oswald, sans-serif;"><br><strong><em>Uploading Comics</em></strong><br></h1>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Preparations&nbsp;</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>First the comic has to be stored in a folder where the images of the comic are named in sequential order <em>(01.png, 02.png, 03.png...). </em>Make sure however (and make sure the comic's submitter is also aware) that the filenames of the images cannot start with the number. Either have leading zeroes prior to the number&nbsp;<em>(001.png, 012.png, 130.png...) </em>as many zeroes as can fit the largest number in the filenames or simply put descriptive text before the number <em>(titleofcomic_1.png,&nbsp;titleofcomic_2.png...) </em>just make sure the text stays the same. If I were telling members how to submit their comics for say the anthology, I'd just tell them to name it as:<br><br><em>page_1.png, page_2.png, page_3.png, and so on...</em><br><br>To avoid overcomplicating it. I wrote the alternatives above in case that's preferable for you but I'll also put the technical explanation for why naming files like:<br><br><em>1.png, 2.png, 3.png, and so on...</em><br><br>...can be catastrophic in the FAQs.</p>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Exporting and export settings</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>With Python installed, open up the <em>Lue Comic Generator</em> repository. It should look something like this:</p><img src="/assets/img/lue2.png">
            <p>Double-click the file&nbsp;<em>(or right-click it and hit Open) </em>to run it. You should see a simple app pop-up that looks like this:</p><img src="/assets/img/lue1.png">
            <p>Comic title and author are self-explanatory. Image directory refers to the folder where all the images of the comic are being stored (make sure not to also include the thumbnail).<br><br>Reading orientation and Background color have to be filled in but for nearly every comic out there:<br><br><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Webtoons/Seamless scrolling style = Vertical</span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Traditional/Paged style = Horizontal</span></em></strong><br><br>And for the background color you'd mimic the background/paper color of the comic in question. In cases where the background color changes (such as when in Webtoons where a different background color can represent a period of time other than the present), use your own discretion but I'd generally lean towards <em>Light </em>more often.<br><br>Once you've picked your settings, click <strong>Render </strong>and your default web browser will open up the <strong>Exported </strong>result. If it's not to your liking you can change settings and re-render it. Just keep in mind that the comic may be read on phones as well as desktops and that you'll have to preview how that will look like either with tools within your web browser or your phone when the updated website is already out and public. About making it public actually...</p>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Source Control (continued)</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>The process for uploading changes from <em>Bootstrap Studio</em> and from <em>Lue Comic Generator</em> work the same way. <strong>Export, Commit, Push. </strong>Exporting however isn't quite done after hitting the <strong>Export </strong>button when uploading comics however.<br><br>After your generated comic is to your liking you can finalize the export by hitting<em>&nbsp;Ctrl+S or&nbsp;⌘+S </em>while you have the exported comic opened in your web browser. A file dialog should pop up asking you where to save the file. Navigate to the ASHS Grafiction repository on your computer and then open up the <em>comics </em>folder. Rename the file and then click <em>save</em>. The format thus far for the renamed file is "<em>lowercasetitleofcomicwithoutanyspaces.html</em>" but that's open to change. Just choose a format and stick to it, maybe edit this paragraph once you do.<br><br>Then just&nbsp;<strong>Commit </strong>then&nbsp;<strong>Push</strong>.&nbsp;Finished.<br><br>Just need to link to the comic now...</p>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Thumbnail and description</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>On the comics page of ASHS Grafiction <em>(comics/index.html)</em>, all the comics and their thumbnails are arranged in a grid. In <em>Bootstrap Studio,</em>&nbsp;the grid is made up of elements called <strong>Cards.</strong><br><br>To add a new thumbnail you need to make a new row as well so right click on one of the&nbsp;<strong>Card Groups&nbsp;</strong>in the <em>Overview</em> (top left) and right-click it and click <em>Duplicate </em>(you could also hit&nbsp;<em>Ctrl+D or&nbsp;⌘+D. </em>Then edit one of the <strong>Cards. </strong>Change the description, author, and thumbnail until you're happy and now we just need to change what URL the thumbnail brings you to when you click it.<br><br>We're going to have to go into the code for this one but this'll be the only time. Ever. I'll walk you through it so just pay attention.<br><br>Drag up the <strong>HTML </strong>panel next to the <strong>Styles </strong>panel at the bottom of your screen. There'll also be an <strong>Attributes </strong>section below the HTML panel. There'll be a lot of code but don't worry just focus on the part where the blue box is. Does it say <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">class="card"</span></em> or <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">class="card-body"</span></em>&nbsp;anywhere? If so, you're on the right track. Otherwise, go back and select the card again.<br></p><img src="/assets/img/card.jpg">
            <p>Now, click on the line that says&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">img class="card...</span></em>&nbsp;and it should look something like this:<br></p><img src="/assets/img/card2.jpg">
            <p>We're going to edit one of the attributes but only one so I've blurred out the rest because you can ignore all of that. Just focus on <strong>onclick.</strong><br><br>That part next to it is the code the runs whenever someone clicks or taps on the thumbnail and it sends them to the correct URL. We're going to edit that code but just the URL to keep it simple. You can do this in a separate window maybe in a text editor (just not Google Docs or Microsoft Word because those tend to mess with code for reasons I'll put in the FAQs) or in the form box itself.<br><br>The code is:</p><code>if(!thisisaphone() &amp;&amp; firstTap){&nbsp;window.open('https://ashsgrafiction.com/comics/<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">untitled</span></em></strong>'); } else if (thisisaphone() &amp;&amp; firstTap){&nbsp;firstTap = false; } else if (!firstTap){&nbsp;window.open('https://ashsgrafiction.com/comics/<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">untitled</span></em></strong>'); }</code>
            <p>I've highlighted the part you're changing. You don't even need to change the whole URL out just change the part after<em> /comics/ </em>to the format you used earlier to export the comic you're linking to. Once that's been changed out you're done. Just remember that <strong>the URL appears twice </strong>so change it twice.<br><br><em>PSA: This is due to me having a small lapse in judgement while writing this code early on that I'm only caught now. If need be try replacing the code in there with this code. It hasn't been tested though so I don't recommend it.</em></p><code>url='https://ashsgrafiction.com/comics/<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">untitled</span></em></strong>';if(!thisisaphone() &amp;&amp; firstTap){&nbsp;window.open(url); } else if (thisisaphone() &amp;&amp; firstTap){&nbsp;firstTap = false; } else if (!firstTap){&nbsp;window.open(url); }</code>
            <p>Save and export your changes as you would normally and it should work after being uploaded to Github.<br><br><strong>It should not work while previewing. </strong>The link leads to the public website and not the preview website but as long as you're not changing anything drastic, the code should function fine and not require further testing or previewing. Make sure you keep the <em>' '</em> around the URL or the code will fail though.</p>

            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Custom Banners</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>A site-banner must be able to fit both a desktop screen and a mobile phone. Because of this we display banners centered on the middle and with their extra width cut off if the screen isn't wide enough. Because of this, I highly recommend making banners that fit a 16:9 or wider ratio, while keeping the entire title and information within the banner all within the middle.<br><br>Making the banner itself in Bootstrap Studio isn't difficult as you can simply copy-paste previous banners (the Kickass banner has the least amount of extra fluff so use that) and change out the image. Changing the image however is a little different from say, image elements as it uses the background-image attribute instead. To edit the image of a banner, open the <strong>Appearance </strong>tab (the one with the artist palette in the upper right) and scroll to <strong>Background</strong>. From there click on the pencil next to the current image to select a different image.<br></p><img src="/assets/img/banner.png">
            <h6><br><strong><em>Parallax</em></strong></h6>
            <p>Parallax Banners require two elements, a version of the banner without parallax and a version with parallax. This might be a little fiddly but you can copy and paste these two elements from the home page (these make up the banner for SY20-21's anthology).<br><br>Just make sure to edit the background-image attribute from the <strong>Appearance </strong>panel. Editing the image on top (by double-clicking the element like you would an image element) won't do anything.</p>
            <ul></ul>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Navbar &amp; Footer</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>It's important to update the website's footer if a major external link has changed such as the <em>Grafiction Facebook Page URL</em> or the <em>Grafiction Constitution</em>. While the navbar (the bar at the top of every page) can be updated sitewide (albeit with moderate HTML experience) the footer must be edited manually for every page. For now. Currently, I'm working on making that automatic as well. The only issue with automating these to update sitewide is that it requires editing code manually to add say new links. I won't detail how to do it here but just hit me up if I haven't gotten around to making it easier as well.</p>
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Videos</em><br><br></h5>
            <p><em>Bootstrap Studio</em> doesn't seem to have much in the way of resources when it comes to putting up videos. There is a built-in element however, you're just going to drag that wherever you need it and then add this attribute:</p><img src="/assets/img/src.png">
            <p>Replace the URL there with your Youtube video's unique identifier. It looks like this highlighted text:</p><img src="/assets/img/url.png">
            <h5 class="text-start" style="font-family: ABeeZee, sans-serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br><em>Artwork Gallery</em><br><br></h5>
            <p>In its current state, the <strong>Artwork Gallery</strong> is pretty much just a big grid of images, and adding new images should be as easy as copy-pasting old sections, adding the image, and moving it all around. Soon, I'll make a version that's more elegant.</p>

            <p><strong>Only one person can be editing the .bsdesign file of the website at a time. </strong>If multiple versions of the file are made with different changes, one of the files will have to be uploaded to the Grafiction GDrive while the other set of changes must either be repeated after the new version is uploaded or abandoned.<br><br><strong>Uploading comics can be done simultaneously by different people, as long as you aren't editing the same comic. </strong>The majority of Grafiction's website is within the .bsdesign file used by Bootstrap Studio. The rest of the website is made up of pages generated by the Lue Comic Generator. Since these pages are separate from the beginning they can be safely uploaded and edited by different people as the changes will be merged by Github. Just make sure to assign which comics will be uploaded or edited by whom and to pull from Github whenever a new commit is made.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Oswald, sans-serif;"><br><strong><em>FAQs</em></strong><br></h1>
            <p><strong>I can't add new lines while typing.&nbsp;</strong>The <em>Enter </em>or <em>Return </em>key instead of making a new line in <em>Bootstrap Studio </em>instead boots you out of the editing and needs you to reselect the object you were typing in. Hit <strong>Shift+Enter </strong>instead<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and then it should make a new line.</p>
            <p><strong>How do you revert changes in Github Desktop? </strong>TBA</p>
            <p><strong>Why is it important to not name images with just their page number? </strong>TBA</p>
            <p><strong>Why can't I edit code in Google Docs/Microsoft Word? </strong>TBA</p>
            <p><strong>How do you make a multilevel list from a normal list? </strong>Search for the list element under the Studio tab to the top left of your screen, then look for your list under Overview (to your bottom left). Open the list by clicking the arrow next to it (if not open already). The List Items should appear then you can drag the list element from under the Studio tab to the List Item and it will create a second list on another level. It should appear as so:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1<ul>
                        <li>Element 1</li>
